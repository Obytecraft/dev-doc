# Welcome
We want to officially welcome you to Decathlon as a developer. We warmly welcome you. oh! first advice,
get to know the team members quickly.  

## Purpose
The purpose of this document is to serve as a guide for you. This will help you integrate faster as a developer. It is advisable to take your time and treat this document as an integral part of your general induction.

## The Playing Field
At Decathlon, you own your personal development. There will be occasions when other engineers will share their experience with other technologies or tools. 
Make sure you sign up for those ones if you have the time to spare.  

## Skills You Can Develop
The Solutions and Technology team cares about your development as an Engineer. Due to that, we have compounded a list of skills
you can develop.

### The Rule 
In Decathlon, we rely on the ```70% + 20% + 10%``` rule. 
This means, you need to ```70%``` do things by yourself. In short, you learn by practising. The
```20%``` for asking for help from other experienced developers around, peer review / programming, and coaching. The ```10%``` is the use of
Google.

### Context 
* Decathlon carries on its acceleration and expansion strategies. We open new countries and lots of new stores.
* In parallel, we transform our business model, adapted to the digital word. Moving from a classic retailer business to a business using more efficiently the strengths of digital. In order to propose the best user centric experience not matter the channel of contact or exchange.
* We would like to continue to let more space to each countries in their decisions and customers experiences (Subsidiarity) but as a group and also in links with our values, we encourage sharing and support between our network of countries (United).

### Solution and Technology 
Solutions and technology is in the heart of these strategies. We have to provide the best adapted answer to them.

We used to design all our solutions in a centralized model and then spread them in our countries. This model is not adapted anymore to :
Our expansion strategies which required capacities to animate in parallel lots of expansion projects. All of them have their constraints and should propose the best local experience adapted to local users.
The new digital world and customers : required lot of agility and reactivity

Our Information System is not enough connected and connectable using a modular and service approach to provide this agility and reactivity.

We need many skills and expertise to transform and move a step forward. And it will be complicated and not adapted to have all these skills in one place in the world. 

We have the ambition to build a network of skills and a network of solutions designers/responsible. 
This network will use our existing Worldwide pool of teammates (In France, India, China, Spain …)  and at the target should let anybody having the possibility to contribute.
To make it possible and efficient we need to have a frame of collaboration, our playing field. 
The purpose of this document is to start to define the playing field of the solutions that we will design or manage. 


### Our Target
To make it possible:
* I master with some internal skills my service/solutions : developers, product owner and technical architect.
* Before developing a new service, I have to check that this service does not already exist and I can later decide to amend it or redevelop it if it makes sense for me, respecting the playing field.
* Each single functions of my solutions should be developed open, generic and connectable using web API.
* Encourage everyone to contribute to projects.

  <tr>
    <td>I have to manage my product life cycle (road maps, releases, end of life …)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My solution/product should manage an ascendant compatibility to ensure a perennity of the service I deliver</td>

  <tr>
    <td>When I develop a service/solution I have the responsibility to identify the right level of granularity, to make my function re-usable.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>
 I design solutions including high availability and scale up capabilities</td>
